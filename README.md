# Power Platform for Prompt Engineering

Welcome to the Power Platform for Prompt Engineering repository! This repository focuses on exploring prompt creation techniques for GPT models and demonstrates an AI-powered healthcare solution leveraging Power Platform.

## Understanding Parts of a Prompt

In the realm of GPT models, a prompt comprises two crucial parts: the 'instruction' and the 'context.' This repository explains the significance of these components in directing AI responses:

### Characteristics of an Effective Prompt

- **Clear & Concise:** Crafted in easily understandable language.
- **Specific:** Offers precise guidance to steer GPT models.
- **Contextual & Relevant:** Provides ample context for generating meaningful output.

## Getting Started / Pre-requisites

To get started with this solution, ensure you have the prerequisites set up:

- Your Power Platform environment in the United States.
- Allow-listed tenant (during private preview).
- Power Apps or Power Automate license.
- Dataverse database installed in your environment.
- AI Builder add-on.

## Usage

Follow these steps to import this solution:

1. **Download the Unmanaged PowerApps Solution:** Download the zip file from the repo named [PromptEngineeringHealthCare_1_0_0_2.zip](PromptEngineeringHealthCare_1_0_0_2.zip)
2. **Import Solution to your environment:** Sign in to Power Apps, navigate to the right environment. Go to Solutions > Import Solution > Select the downloaded file from Step 1.
3. **Publish all customizations:** Once the import process is complete, click on "Publish all customizations".
4. **Add Sample Data:** Download the csv file named [Sample Data.csv](Sample Data.csv) from the repo and add to your Dataverse table > Add sample values into the "Name" column.

## Steps to Create an AI Healthcare Solution from scratch

1. **Creating Custom Prompts:** Utilize Power Apps to craft tailored instructions for medical instrument usage.
2. **Dataverse Table Setup:** Establish a structured database for medical devices.
3. **Canvas PowerApp Development:** Develop a user-friendly app to retrieve and display prompt-generated instructions.
